      # which are used by opa-connector to validate the connection to the manager if
      # mtls is enabled.
      # The CA certificates key in the secret should have `.crt` suffix.
      # The provided certificates replaces the certificates in the system CA certificate store.
      # If the secret is not provided then the CA certificates are taken from the system
      # CA certificate store, for example `/etc/ssl/certs/`.
